# Sock
Nowadays, global connectivity generates tremendous amounts of data and increases the need for _Real-Time Systems_ (RTS). These systems consist of hardware and software components that execute tasks under strict timing constraints. They are used in a wide variety of applications, such as connected vehicles, smart homes, e-health, and Industry 4.0. While RTS offer enormous opportunities to improve our lives, they also introduce significant security risks. However, the literature has largely neglected time-aware security in periodic task-based RTS, even though time is a crucial factor that directly affects system security. To address this gap, we propose Sock, a clock-based modeling language and toolchain that enables developers to design, execute, and reason about periodic task-based RTS. Sock is implemented as a set of Eclipse plugins using the GEMOC Studio, which provides generic components for building executable modeling languages. The operational semantics of Sock are specified using finite state machines equipped with logical clocks associated with tasks and resource operations. To evaluate Sock, we implemented two time-dependent attacks from the state of the art and executed them on Sock models. Our evaluation shows that Sock helps developers avoid sensitive information leakage and warns them of potential abnormal behavior within their systems.
